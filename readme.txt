This WordPress plugin attempts to link OptimizePress purchases to an AffiliateWP ID

== Description ==

Transaction Integration for AffiliateWP and OptimizePress attempts to link OptimizePress purchases to an AffiliateWP ID based on IP address and cookie values. This plugin requires OptimizeMember and AffiliateWP plugins and functions as an intermediate linker between them.

If active, Transaction Integration for AffiliateWP and OptimizePress will attempt to establish a link between the transaction and an affiliate. Currently, only PayPal OptimizePress transactions are being linked.
